# Advances-In-Data-Science-Fall-2023
Learning by doing! I'm sharing my beginner portfolio of mini-projects from my Master's program at ITU. These Python projects explore basic machine learning, and I hope they can be a helpful resource for others starting their data science journey.
This repository is a showcase for all the projects developed for the "Advances in Data Science" course.
